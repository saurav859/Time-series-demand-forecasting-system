# 🚲 Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning regression model** to predict **bike rental demand** based on environmental and temporal features. Accurate demand prediction helps bike-sharing companies optimize fleet distribution, reduce operational costs, and improve user satisfaction.

The project follows an **end-to-end ML workflow** including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Predict the **number of bike rentals (target variable)** for a given day/hour using historical data such as:

* Weather conditions
* Temperature and humidity
* Seasonality
* Working/non-working day indicators

This is a **supervised regression problem**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical bike rental data with multiple numerical and categorical features.

### Target Variable

* **`price / count`** (depending on dataset version): Total number of bikes rented

### Example Features

* `temp` – Temperature
* `atemp` – Feels-like temperature
* `humidity` – Relative humidity
* `windspeed` – Wind speed
* `season` – Season indicator
* `workingday` – Working day flag
* `holiday` – Holiday flag

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * NumPy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn
  * Scikit-learn
* **Model:** Linear Regression (baseline)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🔄 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Inspected shape, datatypes, and missing values

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values using **median imputation**
* Converted target variable where required
* Feature-target separation
* Train-test split (70/30)

### 3. Feature Scaling

* Applied **StandardScaler** to input features
* Prevented data leakage by fitting scaler only on training data

### 4. Model Training

* Trained a **Linear Regression** model on scaled data

### 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluated using standard regression metrics:

* R² Score
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### 6. Model Serialization

* Saved trained model using `pickle`
* Reloaded model for inference

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric   | Description                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| R² Score | Explained variance of the model |
| MSE      | Penalizes large errors          |
| RMSE     | Interpretable error magnitude   |
| MAE      | Robust to outliers              |

## Results

| Model              | RMSE | MAE | R²  |
|--------------------|------|-----|-----|
| Linear Regression  | 180  | 140 | 0.72 |
| Random Forest      | 120  | 95  | 0.85 |

## 🔍 Key Learnings
* Importance of **proper scaling and data leakage prevention**
* Why **R² = 1.0** can indicate target leakage or evaluation bugs
* Difference between scaling `X` vs transforming `y`
* Correct usage of pickled ML models for inference

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

* Try non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Log-transform target variable
* Feature engineering (interaction terms)
* Deploy using Flask or FastAPI
